Sublime Text 2 plugin for Varnish
===========================

This was originally developed by (Zephirworks)[https://github.com/zephirworks/Varnish.tmbundle] and forked here to keep up-to-date.

Installation on a Mac:

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User 
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/zephirworks/Varnish.tmbundle/master/Syntaxes/VCL.tmLanguage
```

Restart your Sublime text. That's it!
